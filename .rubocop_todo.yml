# The point is for the user to remove these configuration records
# one by one as the offenses are removed from the code base.
# Note that changes in the inspected code, or installation of new
# motorefi_versions of RuboCop, may require this file to be generated again.

# It may be possible for us to use safe_load, but we'd have to pass the
# safelists, like `whitelist_classes` into our serializer, and the serializer
# interface is a public API, so that would be a breaking change.
# Offense count: 13
# Cop supports --auto-correct.
